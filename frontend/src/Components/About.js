      <h2 className='pb-3'>Hi, Iâ€™m Yuvraj Singh Rajput. Nice to meet you.</h2>
      <p >I have worked on MERN stack. I have made various projects on it such as GoFood, Keeper, iNotebook, To-Do List App etc.
        I started my journey with HTML, CSS and JavaScript and then further improved my tech stack by learning frameworks such as
        BootStrap, Express js and React js. I have also learned to integrate my web app with database using MongoDB.
        Apart from my web development skills, I have also learned Data Structures and Algorithms with C++ laguage. I have solved more than 400
        questions on Data Structures and Algorithms on various platforms like LeetCode, GeeksForGeeks, CodeStudio and InterviewBit.
        I have also learned Structured Query Language.
      </p>
      <p>I'm quietly confident, naturally curious, and perpetually working on improving my skills.</p>
